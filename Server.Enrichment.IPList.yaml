  Enrich IP addresses supplied. 
  
  This artifact requires both Geo ISP and Geo IP MaxMind databases to be configured under Server.Enrichment.GeoIPISP and Server.Enrichment.GeoIP respectively
  
  You may supply the IPs in 3 different ways, and the priority order of arguments is the following
  
  - (1) If a single IP is supplied, only it will be resolved;
  - (2) If the CSV table has values manually inputted, only the table will be resolved;
  - (3) If a CSV list is uploaded under tool 'CSV_IP_LIST', only the CSV list will be resolved (The fist column name must be "IP")
