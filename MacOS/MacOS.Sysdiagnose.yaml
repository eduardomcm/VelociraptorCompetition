  This artifact executes MacOS sysdiagnose tool and uploads the compressed output for further investigation.
  
  The sysdiagnose tool gathers system diagnostic information helpful in investigating system performance issues.  A great deal of information is harvested, spanning system state and configuration. The data is stored /var/tmp directory.  sysdiagnose needs to be run as root, therefore your client needs to be running as root.

   What sysdiagnose collects:
   
    -   A spindump of the system
    -   Several seconds of fs_usage ouput
    -   Several seconds of top output
    -   Data about kernel zones
    -   Status of loaded kernel extensions
    -   Resident memory usage of user processes
    -   Recent system logs
    -   A System Profiler report
    -   Recent crash reports
    -   Disk usage information
    -   I/O Kit registry information
    -   Network status
    
   This artifact may take longer than 10 minutes, so adjust the timeout to avoid issues.
